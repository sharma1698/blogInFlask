Error 1:
* flask db init
* Ignoring a call to 'app.run()' that would block the current 'flask' CLI command.
   Only call 'app.run()' in an 'if __name__ == "__main__"' guard.

Ans: Flask CLI (like flask db init, flask run, etc.) loads your app from main.py, and it doesn't want app.run() to execute automatically.
Wrapping it in if __name__ == "__main__": ensures it only runs when you run the file directly, not when Flask imports it.

Error2:
ImportError: cannot import name 'db' from partially initialized module 'models' (most likely due to a circular import) (c:\Users\shank\Desktop\PycharmProjects\blogInFlask\models\__init__.py)

Ans: means you're running into a circular import issue — where two files are trying to import each other at the same time, which causes confusion during initialization.
example define ( from .contact import Contact  # ❌ this causes circular import   ) in models/__init__.py
You’re importing Contact too early inside models/__init__.py, but Contact is already trying to import db from models.

Error3:
RuntimeError: A secret key is required to use CSRF.

Answer: import os
class Config:
    SECRET_KEY = os.urandom(24)  # Generates a random secret key
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql://root:root@localhost/flask_blog'
    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False


Error4: Exception: Install 'email_validator' for email validation support.

Answer: pip install flask flask-wtf email_validator
Email() validator in WTForms → calls email_validator to check:
Proper email format (user@example.com)
Unicode and internationalized addresses
Optional DNS checking for domain


Error5: jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'form' is undefined
   pass form to :    return render_template('contact.html',form=form)

Error6: TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object, got 'int'
Answer:  the issue is that Regexp validator in WTForms expects the field’s data to be a string,
but you’re using IntegerField, which gives an int.
Use StringField + Regexp if you want to allow things like +91 or formatted numbers later.

Error7: sqlalchemy.orm.exc.UnmappedInstanceError: Class 'contact.Contact' is not mapped
Answer: The reason you still got the UnmappedInstanceError earlier is because you were trying to use the FlaskForm class named Contact in db.session.add() instead of this model.
Since both were named Contact, Python used the form class, not the model class — and SQLAlchemy complained because that class is not mapped to the database.
How to Fix
Rename one of them so that there’s no name clash.
Keep:
Contact (model) → for DB operations
ContactForm (form) → for form validation
