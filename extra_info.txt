1. why use integrity :
    - That "sha384-ABC123..." part is a cryptographic hash
    - When your browser fetches bootstrap.min.js, it reads the entire file content into memory.
    - Browser takes the downloaded file content.
    - Uses the algorithm mentioned in the integrity value (here sha384 = SHA-384 algorithm).
    - Generates its own hash from the downloaded file.
    - If Browser Hash == Integrity Hash in HTML then file is safe otherwise blocked

2. Why use cross-origin:
When you try to access something from a different origin, that’s a cross-origin request.
how allow it :
The server hosting the resource must send special headers, e.g.:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://yourwebsite.com
“Yes, I trust this origin to read my data.”
